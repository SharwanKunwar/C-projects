## Projects 01  Age conveter:

This C program calculates age and converts dates between Bikram Sambat (BS) and Gregorian (AD) calendars. It features a menu-based interface for easy navigation, supporting age calculation, BS to AD conversion, and AD to BS conversion using a year difference of 56 or 57. Designed for Nepalese users, it is simple, user-friendly, and easily extendable for future improvements.


## Projects 02 Encryption and Decryption:

This C program performs encryption and decryption using a simple Caesar Cipher (+5 shift) method. It allows users to encrypt a word by shifting each character forward by 5 and decrypt it by shifting backward by 5. The program features a menu-based interface for easy navigation and includes console formatting for better readability. Designed for simplicity, it is user-friendly, practical, and easily extendable for more advanced encryption techniques.
